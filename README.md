# lactofermentation: 
## home experiments with lacto-fermentation

Contains data collected and code written while playing around with lacto-fermentation at home
* **data:** contains three files that can all be joined on ferment_id (ferment.csv, ferment_ph.csv, and ferment_ingredient.csv)
* **src:** contains R code playing around with existing data
* **results:** figures

So far, my best ferment by far has been green beans with garlic and peppers.

Currently tracking mainly pH over time, in the future, may expand to tracking temperature and/or rate of bubbling
